    Hi Haim,

        I haven't dealt with COBOL programs recently.  Can you
        send me your compile JCL?  I think the author of this
        program is in China, but did you try writing to him?
        Maybe he is still at the address that is in the file.  I
        am including that address in the reply.

        All the best of everything to you and your family.

    Sincerely,    Sam

      Hi Sam

      I would appreciate your help with this issue:

      While trying to compile the COBOL program SMF110S1 of
      file 806,  I get "SMF110OP" was not defined as a
      file-name.

    Thanks,       Haim
